Greetings 🖖 I am ***Marc Prud'hommeaux*** (pronounced *ˈprʊːdəˌmoʊ* in en-US, *prydəmo* in fr-FR)<!-- and Miss Jackson if you're nasty -->.

I have been programming computers since 1983. <!-- O.G. --> I now mostly write applications in the Swift language for Linux and Apple platforms, but I have broad experience in C, Rust, SQL (many flavors), JVM languages (Java, Scala, Kotlin), JS, etc. <!-- and All. That. Jazz. -->

Here are some things I'm working on.

#### Free Software: <!-- Virtue time! -->

* [🌞 Sun Bow](https://github.com/Sun-Bow): An open source weather app for iPhone, iPad and macOS ([join the TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/IrPLgy5Q) for frequent beta releases, or [🥰 star](https://github.com/Sun-Bow/App) the repo for encouragement!)
* [🌈 WeatherTiq](https://github.com/tiqtiq/WeatherTiq): An OSS drop-in [WeatherKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/weatherkit) replacement for Linux, macOS12, and iOS15 (please [star ⭐](https://github.com/tiqtiq/WeatherTiq) the framework!)
* [<img alt="The App Fair icon" align="center" style="width: 24px;" src="https://appfair.net/appfair-icon.svg" /> The App Fair](https://appfair.net): An automated distribution network for macOS apps providing security and trustworthiness through reproducible builds with GitHub actions (please [🐦 follow on Twitter](https://twitter.com/theappfair), [🗨️  join the Discord](http://discord.gg/R4bFP8qpw7), or [💫 build your own app](https://appfair.net/#quick-start)!)
* [   App Fair.app](https://appfair.app): A native macOS catalog application for the App Fair and Homebrew Cask appsource catalogs (please [💎 download](https://github.com/App-Fair/App/releases/latest/download/App-Fair-macOS.zip) and [star ⭐](https://github.com/App-Fair/App) the app, or `brew install app-fair`)
* [💝 Open source](https://github.com/marcprux): I contribute to numerous other open source projects, including the [⚖️ Fair.git](https://github.com/fair-ground/Fair/) modules that power App Fair apps and distribution (please [star 🤩](https://github.com/fair-ground/Fair) the repo!)

#### Profiteering: <!-- Oh man, I am wicked broke! -->

 * 🤓 **Consulting**: I specialize in designing and creating green-field client (SwiftUI) / server (Vapor) native app platforms for iOS, macOS, and Linux ([🤙 reach out](mailto:marc@prux.org) and get an MVP launched fast! 🚀) <!-- Seriously, like you'll have a beta in a week or two. -->
 * 😔 **Hiring**: I am unavailable for permanent hire (but don't let that stop you from [asking anyway 🙄](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcprux/)) <!-- If we must. -->
 * 🧐 **On-site Talks**: I sometimes give invited talks and presentations on various Swift development topics ([ping me](https://signal.me/#u/marcprux)) <!-- Send me some jucy tidbits! -->

#### Hobbies:

* 🎹 **Music**: I am an aspiring melodica player. Never had one lesson, but I assure you that that won't stop me from playing at your event! <!-- and ruining it -->
* 🏃 **Running**: I enjoy running, both in my home city of Boston as well as when travelling. I have logged (with RunKeeper) around 8,000 miles (~13,000 km) in the past decade across five continents, including eight half-marathons and five full marathons (most recently Paris 2022) <!-- This signals that I am healthy. -->
* 🛩️ **Airplanes**: I am an FAA-licensed singe-engine fixed-wing aircraft pilot with a commercial certificate, instrument rating, and complex & high-performance endorsements (300 PIC hours in: Cessna 172, Piper Warrior, Archer, Arrow, Diamond DA-40, Cirrus SR-20 and SR-22) <!-- Trustworthiness and attention to detail! -->

#### Older stuff:

* ✍️ I have only ever posted but a single tweet, back in 2008. [Follow me](https://twitter.com/marcprux) and I pledge that I will compose another one once I hit 25k followers. <!-- Last time I checked, I had 46 followers. -->
* 📖 Also back in 2008, I developed [Stanza](https://web.archive.org/web/20111206101048/http://www.lexcycle.com/), the first iPhone ebook reader on the App Store. <!-- I'll tell that story someday. -->
